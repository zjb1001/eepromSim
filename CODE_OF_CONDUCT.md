This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Responsibilities

### Community Leaders

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Contributors

Contributors are expected to help maintain a positive and constructive environment by following this code of conduct and intervening when appropriate.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project maintainers through:

* **Email**: [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]
* **GitHub Issues**: Create a report with the "conduct" tag

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this ban. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Technical Guidelines

In addition to behavioral expectations, we have technical guidelines specific to this automotive embedded systems project:

* **Code Quality**: All contributions must maintain the project's high standards for safety and reliability, especially given the ISO 26262 ASIL-B compliance goals
* **Documentation**: Changes must be properly documented, following the project's existing documentation standards
* **Testing**: All new features or bug fixes must include appropriate tests
* **AUTOSAR Compliance**: Contributions should align with AUTOSAR 4.3 specifications where applicable
